This music video, made for the first single on garbage’s new album, involved
the design of four completely different and individual effects. I was involved
with three. (Judy Roberts created a matte intensive treatment for another
section of the video) First was the task of making Shirley Manson look like a
classic Balinese girl painting using matte painted elements and green screen
footage. To create the porcelain like skin that is characteristic of these
beautiful painting and the stylised hair that is made up of quick brush
strokes was the hardest task. Her footage was heavily treated and combined
with multiple layers of painted elements to create this proprietary look.
Second was creating a stylized backdrop and environment for a limousine
sequence which involved multiple motion control passes and painted / keyed
elements. The car, shot in a studio, had to look like it was on this stylised
freeway. It also had to keep it’s highly polished and rich aesthetic. Motion
control data was converted to a flame camera move to ease the process of
removing the reflections of the set and creating reflections of the street
lights and cityscape. Third was the creation of a city backdrop for Shirley’s
final performance which again used multiple layers of matte painted elements
and heavily treated footage of shirley.
