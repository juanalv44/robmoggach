Despite winning broadcast magazine's pig of the week award for the ad's
concept, this commercial was beautifully shot. The body of the commercial
involved primarily cosmetic fixes (some far more complex than others) and
intelligent conformimg of what were at times 10 or more mixing and dissolving
layers. Actors were also composited into real settings using footage shot
against green screen. The bulk of the post time was spent creating the end
sequence which again was a complicated conform more traditionally suited to
henry but completed in inferno with careful management of edit layers and more
powerful matting and compositing tools.
