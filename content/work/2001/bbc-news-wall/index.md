To depict the BBC’s all-encompassing coverage of world events, the collapse of
the Berlin Wall was chosen as the subject of this commercial. A young man
leaves his house and travels through the streets of East Berlin to join a
crowd busy destroying the wall. Because the commercial was shot in 2001, East
Berlin has lost a lot of what made it look like it did. Practically every shot
of the commercial required visual effects work for this reason. An existing
section of the wall was used for the commercial but this did not extend off
camera and the guard towers no longer were in place. I extended the wall and
created new guard towers using a combination of shot elements and elements I
painted in Inferno. Graffiti and commercial advertising did not exist in East
Berlin before the collapse. Now it’s everywhere and as a result almost every
shot in the commercial required that I remove graffiti and billboards.
Walter’s documentary style requires a lot of hand held camera work which made
this task more difficult. Other effects work included creating a massive
crowd, adding graffiti to the wall on the West side, and multiple composition
changes involving moving and adding of buildings.
