This commercial, shot in Argentina and northern Canada, tells the story of a
“hare-sized” SUV that along with it’s hare companions narrowly escapes a puma.
Practically every shot involved a great deal of complex visual effects. The
first task was to successfully create a miniature Saturn among a herd of
arctic hares. Footage of the real truck was shot using the rabbit location and
a miniature truck for size and position reference. Reflections of the rabbits
and surrounding mountain / forest were added, in addition to multiple snow
elements, to create a miniature from the original full size truck. The second
task was to create arctic hares. Because of a lack of suitable white rabbits,
brown rabbits were used. The brown rabbits were made white and their ears were
lengthened to create the hares. Each shot consists of at least three hares
shot separately in different positions. To add to the complexity of the
effects, the majority of the footage was shot hand-held to give the film a
greater sense of realism and dramatic energy.
