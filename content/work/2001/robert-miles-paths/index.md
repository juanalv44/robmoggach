Director Arran Bowyn envisioned a surreal Giger-esque creature for this music
video for Robert Miles. A woman collapses while carrying a puppet and the
puppet is imbued with life. It sings the song to us while dancing languidly
and we realise that the face on the puppet singing is the woman who had
earlier collapsed. Creating a singing puppet with a somewhat human head was a
big visual effects problem for this music video. Our solution to the problem
was to shoot the puppet without a head and remove the wires in Inferno. This
maintained the characteristic puppet motion. The singer was then fitted with a
prosthetic head that was modelled from the original miniature puppet head. Her
neck in body were covered in chroma blue fabric and she was shot against a
blue screen. This allowed us to track her real head onto the body of the
dancing headless puppet. Removing the puppet strings, recreating realistic
shadows, and rebuilding features hidden by the singerâ€™s neck and body were
some of the main obstacles and a lot of time was spent on cosmetic cleanup
work as well to enhance her beauty.
