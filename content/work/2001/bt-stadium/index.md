To tell the story of British Telecom allowing it’s clients to reach the global
marketplace, director Jake Scott from RSA/Black Dog developed the concept of a
massive stadium where those with a product or even a question could approach
the global audience. Creating this massive stadium was our task seeing as it
is completely fictional. Practically every shot in this commercial involved
multiple crowd replication shots for this infinitely vast fictional stadium.
The shots featured here are wide shots of the stadium that were created using,
at times, more than 40 layers of live action clouds, combined in inferno using
paint and selective matting. Sparks were used to enhance the look and give the
impression of the sun being off camera. The end result was a truly touching
story that showcases different individuals empowered by being able to reach
the audience they couldn’t before.
