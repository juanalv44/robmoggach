Nominated for an Emmy for the most dramatic commercial of 2001, this has been
one of my most memorable commercial projects. Gerard De Thame is world-
renowned for his ‘monumental’ commercials that involve the biggest commercial
productions and the best artists worldwide. Combining multiple motion control
passes of lions, giraffes, elephants, extras, mercedes, full size sets, model
boats and penguins was our task on this commercial for Mercedes Benz. Every
shot involved effects work in some form or other. All the backgrounds still
and moving were created from high resolution stills and multiple cloud footage
elements. Motion control data and 3D tracking information was used in inferno
throughout. For the opening panning shot of the animals entering the ark I had
the job of creating a background desert plane and sky that matched the live
action motion control set, model and animal elements and integrating the boat
set and model. The dramatic closing helicopter shot of the ark was created
with one live action motion control element of the ark and one oversized
stitched background image. Using 3D projections and selective matting and
tracking the illusion of a 3D environment was created. The same methods were
used in varying degrees of complexity for the Mercedes sequence and other
moving shots throughout the spot.
