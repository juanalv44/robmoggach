Muse is one of the most popular rock bands in the United Kingdom. Their albums
are known for multiple best-selling singles. A lot of importance is therefore
afforded to the creation of their unique and creative music videos. This music
video depicting a man falling through a dramatic science-fiction landscape in
deep space involved heavy effects work on almost all the shots. The sequence
shown here depicts the man falling out of the massive spaceship / monolith and
into open space. Backgrounds were created entirely in Inferno using a
combination of different proprietary plug-ins and animated elements. I created
a massive star field environment in Inferno within which the live-action
singer could plummet. With this environment created we were able to maintain
continuity as the singer fell deeper and deeper into an ever-thickening body
of stars and light.
