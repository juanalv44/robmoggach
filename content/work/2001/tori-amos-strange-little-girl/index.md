For Tori Amos’ new single “Strange Little Girls” director David Slade
envisioned a fictional landscape of blue wheat fields, bright red skies, and a
giant black wolf chasing Tori to her house in the country for the music video.
This required extensive visual effects throughout. One of the big tasks was
creating the surreal skies that were key to the look the director wanted to
achieve. These were painted on the massive backdrop on set and using inferno I
extended the skies past ceiling. The painted backdrop had no real life to it
so I also had to imbue motion into using live action cloud footage and by
warping the existing painted backdrop. The wolf in the video had to appear
massive. This was done for some shots using a miniature set within which the
wolf appeared to be twenty feet tall. In other shots it was isolated and
reintroduced into shots of a smaller scale, with appropriate non-existent
shadows, in Inferno. It also had to appear to be mouse-sized as it enters the
house. In a similar fashion, camera angles were matched for shots of different
scale and integrated. Other effects work included beauty / cosmetic work on
Tori throughout and computer generated wheat fields.
