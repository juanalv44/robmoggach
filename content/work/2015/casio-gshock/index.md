A beautiful spot showcasing Casio's newest line of G-Shock watches for women. I was brought on by Logan to lead the team as VFX Supervisor in collaboration with Design Director Ara Devejian. Photoreal was the goal for this macro style CGI so the focus was Nuke from the onset with Flame for final finish.
