To tell the story of lost souls, alone in the world, director David Slade came
up with this characteristically dream-like treatment. The lost souls in the
video are followed by rain clouds that continually drench them, strengthening
their plight. My job therefore was to create miniature storm clouds that
followed these people. The challenge was to create clouds that maintained
their realism without appearing cartoon-like. The video was shot on multiple
location and used a custom built rain machine to create the selective downpour
that followed the lost souls. Using milk shot in slow motion in water I
created the cloud element that follows these people. The milk was looped,
reshaped, painted and graded to create a sense of directional lighting, and
the rain was enhance with computer generated rain created in Inferno. Other
effects included the star field in the end sequence that involved Inferno
generated stars converging on David Gray on live action footage shot with a
crane. All tracking of the hand held footage was done in Inferno.
