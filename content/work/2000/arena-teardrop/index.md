For this commercial we had to create a photo-realistic tear drop on the face
of a medal winning athlete. The tear was shot in multiple sections on a
mannequin and tracked onto the contours of the athlete's face, neck and chest.
The biggest challenges were the tracking itself, creating realistic highlights
and reflections, the transitions between different tear elements, warping the
tear to match the contours accurately, and matching the various different
focus points in the shot to create one seamless 20 second shot.
