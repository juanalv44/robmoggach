I worked on two shots for this commercial, assisting the lead on the project:
Sean Broughton. The first was a transition from a rockslide to tumbling
guinness foam, pulling back to a pint of guinness pulling back further to a
poster girl holding the pint pulling back further to reveal the girl on the
side of a plane banking away. The second was combining live action plane
footage with the fictitious desert landscape.
