I previz'd this whole spot in the flame using a white room built from stills
and rough CG elements provided by the Houdini team. Once this was done,
editorial cut our selects to create the story. We then had the task of
building the flowers growing using L-Systems in Houdini. An additional
challenge was integrating the shot footage of a giant iguana eye throughout
the spot. This was so much fun to realize and we were given lots of creative
freedom after the initial direction.
