Halifax’s advertising has always had a tongue in cheek humour that lends
itself to the Bollywood theme of this commercial. Director Tarsem Singh
created an epic story of British bank tellers starring in a stereotypical
Indian musical. It’s a hilarious take on a classic concept that was full of
visual effects used to enhance the realism and increase the scale of the
production. I had the task of creating hundreds of dancers where there were
only tens before using multiple passes of live action. Skies were replaced and
colour corrected throughout to enhance the kitchsyness of the commercial. I
also created billboards from the live action talent that were made to look
like sloppily drawn Bollywood film posters. It was a great experience and my
first of many jobs with director Tarsem.
