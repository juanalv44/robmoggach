Set in the collosseum of ancient Rome, this is a story of three gladiators,
played by Britney Spears, Beyonce Knowles, and Pink, joining together to usurp
the Pepsi-hoarding emperor, Enrique Iglesias. The three girls bring the crowd
to an angry roar with a rendition of Queen's "We Will Rock You" and the
emperor is catapulted to the lions by the ensuing noise. We had the task of
creating the entire collosseum of screaming, cheering spectators from one tier
of one half of a replica of the collosseum. CG artists at
[Glassworks](http://www.glassworks.co.uk) in London created tens of layers of
stadium and crowd elements which were all combined in flame. The challenges
included not having any blue or green screens to ease the integration of the
live action and no motion control for the more than 50 wild camera shots
requiring CG. The 3 minute commercial was finished at film resolution and 12
bit colourspace to maximize the quality and allow us to more easily integrate
the CG elements. This in itself presented a problem given the huge amounts of
data that needed to move seamlessly between facilities on an almost daily
basis.
