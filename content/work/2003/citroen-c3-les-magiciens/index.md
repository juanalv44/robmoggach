Flying siblings arguing, as you do, about the configuration of Citro?n's
newest car, use their magical gloves to transform the car. Drawing loose
reference from Japanese animation, the task at hand was to create a magical,
transformation effect that was playful, whimsical and elegant at the same
time. This transition was to be applied to the car as it changed form and in
some instances to the entire landscape as the kids moved from locale to
locale. All the elements were generated in Flame using the built in 3D
capabilities. 3D models of the car were used within Flame to approximate the
surface of the car and create realistic occlusions. For most of the commercial
different takes of both children were used and needed to be combined in post.
The car was shot in all of it's four configurations in situe and animated in
Flame. Matte paintings of the various locations were created to ease the
transitions and create a more interesting visual.
