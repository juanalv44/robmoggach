This commercial depicts a shamanistic figure going about his daily routine of
meditative dance in a harsh yet visually pristine environment. Once his
personal challenges are met he returns to a state of rest and contemplation.
This film was shot in two days at El Mirage Dry Lake Bed in Southern
California by DP Harris Charalambous. Telecine was done by Fergus McCall at
The Mill London. Mark Reynolds of Swordfish edited the commercial and Robert
Moggach did the inferno/online work while at Play Productions in London. This
commercial was featured on the cover of Shots Magazine in August of 2004.
