To depict SBC’s all-encompassing telecommunications networks, the journey of a
wire cable was chosen as the subject of the “Seed” commercial. The wire is
born in an underground box and weaves it’s way across the country. In the
“Quality Service“ commercial SBC’s hardware is shown building and repairing
itself without any human involvment. Both commercials, directed by Andrew
Douglas, are cute stories with epic imagery. Working with CG artists at
Digital Domain I created a completely CG wire which weaved it’s way across
North America. This involved multiple layers of CG elements and live action
elements combined to create a seamless realistic picture. In some
circumstances the real picture was created almost entirely out of elements
generated by CG or the Flame compositing software. Both commercials were full
of visual effects. Every shot was treated in some manner or another! Other
effects work included sky replacements througout to enhance the picture, wiire
removal, monitor replacements, and other small cosmetic fixes.
