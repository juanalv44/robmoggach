When a viewer sees the face of a 12-year-old boy, sweetly warning that the
decisions he makes now will affect his health when he’s much older - they
expect a 12-year-old body to be attached. As the camera dollies out from just
this subject in “Doctor’s Office”, that prepubescent face is attached to a
titanic, obese body.

This is just the latest bit of magic to emerge from Dashing. The studio teamed
up with OPC Directors Woods + Low and Bensimon Byrne to craft the attention-
grabbing spot — a warning from the Ontario Ministry of Health Promotion and
Sport about the dangers of not establishing a healthy lifestyle.

Dashing was involved early on in the process to ensure a believable spot. One
of the principal challenges was fulfilling an agency mandate that the spot be
seamless and real, and also not so disturbing that it distracted from the
central message.

While the concept of accurately attaching a 12-year-old boy’s head to a 40
-year-old overweight man’s body is simple in concept, it required complex
execution. To seamlessly track the boy to the man, tracking markers were
placed in positions of equal proportions all over the face and upper body on
both characters. They then shot multiple passes of the head in different
positions to cover any parts of the performance that didn't allow for clean
integration.

The biggest VFX challenge was getting an accurate track across the neck and
chin of both the boy and man. The fat rolls on the man's chin moved
inconsistently and differently than the thin neck of the boy, making tracking
markers appear and disappear with small gestures and head movements.

“It became clear that this was more than a 2D tracking challenge, and would
have to be solved using a combination of 2D and 3D tools,” said Dashing
Founder/VFX Supervisor Rob Moggach. “We tracked the heads in 3D to accurately
capture the subtle variations in perspective as the man or boy spoke, then
applied it to the head of the boy and body of the man so both moved in unison.
With some adjustment to shadowing and careful attention to tracking accurate
mattes along the jawline, we got it right.”

Using Linux workstations and working in Maya and Nuke for 3D tracking,
Silhouette for rotoscoping, and Autodesk Flame for the final compositing and
online, Dashing spent three weeks completing both this spot and a companion
French version that used entirely different talent and dialogue.

“We’re happy we can take the time to focus on the details with jobs like this.
The subtle details are what we hope will set the quality of our work apart,”
noted Moggach. “We were fortunate to be a part of a great creative team that
supported our approach with a truly collaborative spirit. Everyone had a
common goal and engaged to create a great spot.”

Anchored by Founder/Creative Director Robert Moggach, Executive Producer
Danielle Lyons and a select team of top digital artists, Dashing is tailor-
made for handling projects with demanding and unconventional, creative and
technical challenges.
