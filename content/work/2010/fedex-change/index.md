In this award winning spot, Dashing recently showcased their diversity and
nimble nature in a spot for FedEx, shot by Director Tim Godsall out of BBDO
Toronto. _Change_ stars an effortlessly competent business
executive/surgeon/tattoo artist/chess master/sculptor who orders one of his
office drones to use FedEx for a non-urgent shipment. When the assistant
second-guesses his boss, explaining his belief that FedEx is only good for
urgent shipping needs, he is met with a stern explanation that it's possible
be good at many things.

Dashing complemented Godsall's work with a variety of seamless effects:
creating a real, physics-based trajectory for a golf ball landing perfectly in
a tiny target; using a similar process to create plaster chipping off a
sculpture; perfecting the design and position of a tattoo on the man's back so
it looked as if it was being inked by his own hand, matching the subtle
warping of his skin with deforming tracks and matte painting work.

"The brief was to make everything as natural as possible," noted Dashing
Founder/VFX Supervisor Rob Moggach, who worked in Maya and Flame for all
animation, compositing and finishing. "The comedy of the spot is in the sheer
believability of the extraordinary feats that happen. Going beyond this would
have missed the point. We were careful in this regard not to take any of our
work too far and let cues from real possibilities guide us."

"BBDO was a great partner and trusted our instinct throughout," stated Dashing
EP Danielle Lyons. "From the beginning, Director Tim Godsall was onboard,
knowing instinctively from our reel that with a small brief we'd take the
creative steps necessary to get the job done without any creative hand-
holding." Dashing delivered as promised, putting the final touches on the spot
in just four weeks.
