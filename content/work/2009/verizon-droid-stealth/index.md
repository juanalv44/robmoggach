In this spot a fleet of sleek stealth aircraft drop Verizon's new Droid phone
across America, a futuristic almost alien device that seems to have an
intelligence of it's own. The spot draws on science fiction motifs as much as
suspenseful Hitchcock-esque storytelling ones. Directed by MJZ's Rupert
Sanders, I supervised the extensive visual effects which included a fully CGI
sequence of stealth planes dropping their high-tech packages from high
altitude, multiple pod trails and impact explosions, and sky replacements
throughout. We shot over four days in the mountains and desert around
Palmdale, CA in blistering heat and dust storms. We started the process early
on working in close collaboration with Rupert's production design team to
design the aesthetic of the plane and droid 'pods'. Previsualization was built
as a combination of animated CGI and footage taken from multiple sources. The
editorial goal was always to build a montage that felt like it was cut from a
large selection of dailies as opposed to a meticulous choreographed and
correspondingly unnatural sequence. Whenever we felt that it was feeling too
fluid, composition or shot selection was adjusted to give it a more
naturalistic energy. All the live action explosions, and trails were
composited in Flame. CGI planes and terrain were created in wide array of
packages (Maya, Terragen, Renderman, BodyPaint, etc.) and composited in Nuke
using multiple floating-point, linear light passes. The plane was built from
the ground up combining diffuse, specular, reflection, fresnel, and ambient
occlusion passes and additional lighting tweaks and motion blur were added
using normal passes and motion vector passes. All of this was packaged into a
custom interface that controlled the comp process and guaranteed a consistent
look from shot to shot. Additional custom UI tools were created in Nuke to
create the lens flare and lighting effects that incorporate realistic camera
motion, reflections, and light leaks.
