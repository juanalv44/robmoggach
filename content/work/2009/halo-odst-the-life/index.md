We follow the life of an ODST (Orbital Drop Ship Trooper) in the Halo 3
universe from trainee to hardened veteran. This epic 2-1/2 minute spot for
Halo 3: ODST was as intense a film to produce as it is in it's finished form.
Shot over 4 days in the depths of a working open-pit coal mine, a working
power plant cooling tower, and an abandoned communist era metallurgy factory
the crew endured blistering 110 degree Fahrenheit heat that overnight turned
to 45 degree torrential rain storms with hurricane winds. The grit of these
extreme conditions shone through to create a film that is true to the visceral
aesthetic essential to it's success. With an aggressive schedule for
completion but under slightly more comfortable air-conditioned, Aeron-chaired,
and caffeinated conditions our team of 5 flame artists, 10 CG artists, 2 nuke
artists, and 10 roto artists delivered 80 shots of varying complexity in under
two and a half weeks from 2K flat plates, some shots reaching completion in
the final minutes before delivery.
