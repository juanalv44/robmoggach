Spy Films and Dashing came together to create the ultimate movie-going
experience. Through months of arduous labour, the diverse team has completed a
journey into the celebration of Cineplex’s 100 years of film. The theatrical
brand spot is an immersive and emotional audio-visual experience that
solidifies Cineplex as the leader for a new generation of moviegoers.

The mini-film begins in black and white with the Wright Flyer taking off at
Kitty Hawk, NC. Over the course of 40 seconds we see the film evolve into full
frame, technicolour, mono to 7.1 sound and finally, stereoscopic 3D. All the
while, the planes of history are also evolving…from the Wright Bros to the
NASA space shuttle.

We were excited for this project
because from the very beginning of the creative process it was truly
collaborative. We literally used every creative tool at our disposal and then
created some of our own. The clouds and nebulae were created using custom
software developed for this project. I worked alongside my large team animating, lighting and compositing.

The mini-film played throughout all Cineplex locations nation-wide
more than 3 years. 15 million viewers a month saw the finished film.
