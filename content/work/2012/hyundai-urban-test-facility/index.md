As part of a continuing creative collaboration with Innocean Canada, Dashing
re-visited Hyundai's test facility to put the new Elantra GT through it's
paces. Brought to life by Chris Sargent, we see the GT twist and turn through
filmic projections of the outside world until magically we are driving down a
residential street.

With a month long schedule, it was our huge task to ensure the quality of the photo-real environments and visual aesthetic matched the demanding needs of creative.

It was great to be able to revisit what we created in the Engineering
campaign and evolve the environment, adding details and texture that made it
feel even more grounded in reality. The filmic grit of director Chris
Sargent's style made it an interesting creative departure, introducing light,
flaring and grain that contrasted the very clean, futuristic visuals from the
original campaign.
