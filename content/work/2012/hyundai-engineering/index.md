Dashing shows off the miraculous inner-engineering of Hyundai’s vehicles as
the cars cruise around a massive interior test track in a new five-spot
campaign for Innocean Worldwide. Our bespoke approach to Visual Effects
brought together some of the best talent from around the globe to develop and
execute a gargantuan multi-disciplined effort.

Each spot features a Hyundai vehicle cruising through a surreally lit
postmodern test facility of giant proportions as intricate graphics showing
off the automobiles’ machinations spring onto the screen. Veloster displays
the car’s dual-clutch eco-shift system as it travels through a sheet of liquid
light, Sonata shows off the car's hybrid technology as it travels thousands of
miles, and Tucson examines the inner workings of the SUV’s suspension as it
glides over a bumpy road. The vehicles travel towards a light and, as though
appearing in another dimension, emerge from a suburban garage door, as
narrator Jeff Bridges, summarizes the journey, “Just one of the engineering
advances we’ve brought from our test facility to yours.”

It was inspiring to create something conceptually strong that needed to be
real and functional, without seeming too technical, sci-fi or overly designed,
as many car spots can be. Director Rob Leggatt (Radke Films/MJZ) brought
together an impressive team to design the foundation of this world we were
creating. Production Designer John Beard (Brazil, Last Temptation of Christ)
and Director of Photography Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi, Tron, Benjamin
Button) confidently set the tone early on. Dashing was responsible for
creating the entire world around these cars. Having a truly filmic foundation
meant the CG needed to match that natural, cinematic energy.

Rather than hunker down in a technology bunker with a massive team to push out
the heavy-duty effects, we employ a more dynamic, agile approach by uniting a
highly-skilled onsite team of digital craftsmen with similarly skilled artists
working remotely around the world. There’s alot of hype about this new
paradigm of VFX production, but the reality is there hasn’t been a real
working example in advertising and certainly not at this scale. Small teams of
creative experts truly can deliver incredible results if you give them the
right tools. This project distilled the fact that exceptional, creative visual
effects depend on the individual artists, the digital craftsmen—not a big
established brand. We were fortunate to have our dream team, assembled from
years of experience working worldwide.

Faced with a tight timeframe for a large project, we knew we would have to
streamline the process. Previs and storyboarding took place simultaneously in
studio and on location and continued during the seven day shoot. We had
dedicated tracking and previs teams on set. Editor Chris Van Dyke (School) was
with us as well. Because we shot digitally, we were able to have edits
approved and tracking and rotoscoping started within days and even hours of
the shoot. The team was assembled from artists worldwide based on their
individual expertise and as needed we brought them to the production to
guarantee a smooth collaboration. From plates to delivery, we delivered almost
100 shots of full CGI environments, design and animation in 8 weeks.
