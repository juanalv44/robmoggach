For the artists at Dashing, magic doesn't seem so mysterious. This is proven
True in a :60 spot for Hyundai, produced in collaboration with past live
action partner, OPC, for Innocean Worldwide.

_Magic Wand_ stars a band of four buddies who discover a magic wand on the
side of the road. They immediately conjure up a Hyundai Accent and the crew
launches into an urban adventure. The wand is used to change red stoplights to
green, transport food-bearing waiters into their car, make the guitar-
strumming hula girl on their dashboard come to life, and transport one lucky
bachelor into another Hyundai full of attractive females.

Dashing worked with OPC Director Clay Weiner to fulfill Innocean's vision for
the project, creating magic effects that were succinct, even believable in
their simplicity of execution. "Our main challenge was creating magical
appearing/disappearing effects that were simple and accessible," noted
Creative Lead/Flame: Rob Moggach. "It was imperative that we create a magical
effect that didn't suffer from the usual stereotypes of glowing stardust and
overly processed digital work. It had to feel real." After painting clean
plates, Moggach used subtle warping of the image combined with interactive
lighting effects to create smooth transitions and transformations that feel
more like sleight of hand than digital effects.

With a demanding schedule, Dashing completed the magic effects and extensive
car cleanup work throughout the :60 spot in just two days, using a streamlined
workflow that relied on Autodesk Flame instead of more time consuming CGI or
even rotoscoping. "Innocean was nervous about their tight schedule, but we
pushed ourselves to deliver the promised effects on eight shots and Rob was
determined to also balance the car's aesthetic throughout the spot," said
Dashing EP: Danielle Lyons. "It was refreshing to work with Clay, who brought
a more narrative and comedy-focused experience to a traditional car spot. He
trusted Rob's instinct for the effects work and had a good intuition for how
the VFX would play out and what to shoot, despite a demanding two-day shoot
schedule."

Anchored by Creative Director Rob Moggach, Executive Producer Danielle Lyons
and a team of top digital artists, Dashing thrives on handling unconventional
projects with demanding creative and technical challenges.
