Continuing a successful creative partnership with CP&B Toronto, Dashing,
working with Industry Films Director Brad Parker, handled all CG and VFX on a
two-spot campaign introducing Molson Canadian 67 Sublime beer.

“We recently worked with CP&B Toronto’s creative team for a spot for Canadian
Realtors (CREA) and had a great experience,” stated Dashing EP Danielle Lyons.
“While this new project also incorporated our ability to produce photoreal CG,
it added very natural character animation to the skillsets needed. Rob’s
experience as a character animator along with director Brad Parker’s long VFX
history meant the artists were challenged from the start to deliver a great
animated performance.”

Olives stars a pair of anthropomorphic martinis whose nonchalant pose is
disrupted when a bottle of Molson’s new low-calorie beer slides across their
field of vision. A pair of olives in each glass (the drinks’ eyes) perk up,
look the beer up and down, glance at one another, and then huddle deep in
their glasses in fear as the message “Martinis, beware,” flashes across the
screen.

Dashing built the olives, glasses and martini in CG with Maya, using extensive
puppeteered olives as a reference. “The agency and director wanted the olives
to as natural as possible and completely photo-real,” noted CD Rob Moggach.
“Everyone agreed these needed to feel alive and real as opposed to cartoony so
the puppetteered reference was invaluable. It was essential that they behave
in a realistic way, and integrate into the environment in a very real sense.”
Dashing’s team added the final polish in Flame after compositing with Nuke.
The CG was created in Maya and rendered using VRay.

Anchored by Founder / Creative Director Rob Moggach, Executive Producer
Danielle Lyons and a select team of top digital artists, Dashing is tailor
made for handling unconventional projects with demanding creative and
technical challenges.
