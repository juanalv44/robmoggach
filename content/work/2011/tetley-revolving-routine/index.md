Dashing teams up once again with The Perlorian Bros. on Tetley's "Revolving
Routine", providing a much needed boost to an otherwise dreary day.

In this quirky spot out of john st. Toronto, our hero Stacey is clearly stuck
in a rut. We follow her day in and day out as she goes through the same
motions passing the same photocopier guy "Steve", drinking from the same water
cooler, until one day she discovers Tetley Infusions. One sip and all of a
sudden the world is completely different. There is a spring in her step, gifts
are being delivered by the mailboy, the photocopier guy is hot and he appears
to have a twin! Everything in the world is right.

Dashing composited this spot using Autodesk Flame to ensure seamless tracking
between the plates, clean integration of the second "Steve" and subtle ramping
to help the comedic timing.
