The ballet that is slow motion baby food being flung around a kitchen by some
energetic toddlers was the subject for this spot. Involved from early in the
creative process, Dashing was tasked with not only making the food look great
but grading and finishing the spot in it's entirety.

Director John MacDougall was really intent on a clean and precise aesthetic
for this film. The contrast of subtle gradations of white and the abstract
forms of the slow motion baby food meant getting the right look required
extensive rotoscoping and selective grading not always possible in one colour
session. Instead Dashing opted for a collaborative approach that saw the
colour of the spot evolve along with the compositing.

> “Having the flexibility to grade in flame, make a few tweaks to the roto or
compositing work, look at the cut, and then revise all in an integrated
fashion was a great way to give John full control over the look”

Dashing CD Rob Moggach graded/transferred the spot using a combination of
Flame & Nuke and composited the spot using Flame. Rotoscoping of all the
elements throughout meant he was able to selectively add or remove elements
and change composition on the fly.
