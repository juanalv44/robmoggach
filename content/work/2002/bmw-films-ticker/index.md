A human organ being transported to an awaiting leader of an oppressed third
world country is the basis of the story of this short film/commercial. As the
human organ is transported, opponents of this great leader constantly try to
kill the delivery men who are driving the new BMW Z3.The BMW Films series is
an amazing venture by numerous leading live action directors to create short
films instead of commercials but still maintain a commercial marketability.
This was a challenging job for many of reasons, first of which was the film
finish which instantly adds a layer of complexity with itâ€™s larger image
resolution. The second challenge was to design and create a timer/thermometer
which appears throughout the commercial. I worked closely with two motion
graphic designers to create an animated clock. Using mathematical expressions
to control the time/temperature based on an animated scale, I developed an
effect that was reusable for the more than 30 shots throughout the film. It
was made difficult by the hand held camera motion and the dirt and scratches
that obscured the digital face. Our third big challenge was to create
realistic gunfire throughout. All of this was done entirely in Inferno using
generated and shot elements, tracked in 3D, to allow for realistic depth in
the motion of the 2D elements. Other visual effects included smoke
enhancement, shell casings flying out of the guns, explosion enhancement and a
digital helicopter!
