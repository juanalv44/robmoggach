Visionary music video director, David Slade, had a very defined idea for the
look of this video. The surreal distortion of a otherwise normal boy caught up
in the throws of stardom had to be believable and not interpreted as a special
effect. Using a proprietary combination of selective matting, warping,
sharpening, shading, and adding film grain I created a look that he was
instantly happy with. The technique I developed allowed for a completely
interactive process for the more than 50 shots in the video. Instead of the
usual waiting associated with the detailed nature of this type of project, I
was able to keep David involved in the creative development through the
evolution of every shot. The result is an unsettling set of images that left a
lot of people questioning the methodology and garnering critical acclaim in
the UK and North America.
