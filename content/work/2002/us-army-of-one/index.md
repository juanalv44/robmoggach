This commercial tells the story of the strength of the the individual US Army
Special Forces soldier and the even greater strength of his entire team. It’s
an inspiring commercial set in the high rockies which has the lone soldier
scaling a massive mountain to rendezvous with his team. It’s a visually
beautiful commercial in which special effects are meant to be invisible and
photo realistic. This was a great opportunity to work with international
director Tony Scott. He’s a historic figure who garners much respect for his
filmmaking. As such we had to be meticulous in our execution on all fronts. I
was given the task of enhancing the supplied footage. Some shots involved
inserting the orange flag marker which as an important story point was found
to be too camouflaged in the harsh conditions. Other tasks included,
selectively brightening faces to give the soldiers more personality. The most
difficult task for this job was the actual conform. Editor Skip Chiasson is an
artist in his own right who pushes the envelope for what can be done
editorially. In this 30 second commercial there were over 100 edits!
