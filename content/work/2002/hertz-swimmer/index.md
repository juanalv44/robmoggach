For this commercial we had the monumental task of creating an underwater
environment where before was only a non-descript rental car parking lot. A man
swims through this murky underwater environment searching for his car without
luck. This was a great challenge. The only underwater element I was supplied
with was the man swimming in a tank. The cars, parking lot, bubbles and
caustic lighting were all created in flame using a combination of elements
generated in flame and minimal CGI. Every shot involved isolating each vehicle
independently and applying different localized colour correction to create a
more underwater feel. Caustic lighting elements were generated in flame and
mapped on to CG cars to generate the characteristic lighting. This was then
applied to the previously corrected cars to create the look. After this step
came the task of creating streams of photo-realistic bubbles in flame tracked
perfectly to the scene. Shafts of light and small bits of floating debris were
then added in the final stage during which the live action man was composited
into the scene. Other elements like the surface of the water, the fog that
fades into background and reflections were then added as a final touch to
increase the realism.
