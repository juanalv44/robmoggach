This campaign was created to convey the history of the Buick brand and one of
it’s driving forces, Harvey Earl., who designed a lot of the great cars in the
company’s history. His ghost along with the ghosts of golfers and cars are set
in real environments alongside Tiger Woods. It’s a romantic set of commercials
with numerous stylized yet elegant digital visual effects. I had the task of
putting Tiger Woods into many of the environments using footage shot on a
green screen. His time is limited so we worked quickly to capture what we
needed on set for me to combine later digitally. I also had to create a unique
look for the ghosts in all the commercials that wasn’t too stereotypical and
had an elegance inherent in the story. The resulting light based solution
proved to be the right solution for the job.
