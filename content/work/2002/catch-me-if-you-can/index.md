I had the distinct privelege of working for director Steven Spielberg on his
film “Catch Me If You Can” on approximately ten visual effects shots. We had
the task of creating a view of the cloudscape and of New York from inside the
plane. It was a relatively simple task of keying blue screen footage on top of
flame generated cloudscapes and city backgrounds. It’s a simple task but one
that I still remember fondly given the stature of the director and his cast.
