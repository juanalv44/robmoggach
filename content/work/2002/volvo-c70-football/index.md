This film for the Volvo C70 convertible tells the story of the safety that a
driver feels in the car despite it being a convertible. A football fan drives
through the streets of a picturesque Italian village, daydreaming, and unaware
that the village is full of the opposite team’s fans. When he realises that he
is in potentially hostile territory he locks the doors of his convertible and
feels safe in his car. Our task in this commercial was not create elaborate
special effects that defy any imagination but rather to enhance the beauty of
the footage and the car by isolating the car and making it’s surface appear
shinier and more reflective. In all of the shots of the car, the car was
isolated and enhanced, separately from the rest of the footage. Other effects
work included animating the locking of the door, combining multiple takes of
live action crowds to create a stronger composition, and integrating /
creating footage for the televisions that appear throughout the commercial.
